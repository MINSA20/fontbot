### Fontbot is a bot that allows you to have fancy fonts in your discord chats.

***
# Basic Usage

Prefix: ``$``

Usage: ``$font "Message" FontName Color Size``

*there is already defaults in the command. so most of the time you can just use $font "message" to quickly type out what you want to say*

``$font "Message"``
should be good enough for most messages
***
# Install Command

Fontbot also has support for installing external .ttf fonts. 

Usage: ``$font install [web page link to .ttf] FontName``

FontName can't contain any spaces or symbols. 

**Also, .OTF fonts don't work**
